## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before using the system, you need to configure:

1. Blynk credentials:

   ```cpp
   #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "your_template_id"
   #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "your_template_name"
   #define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "your_auth_token"
   ```

2. WiFi credentials:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "your_ssid";
   const char* password = "your_password";
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

The system includes several safety mechanisms:

- Automatic shutoff after 90 seconds
- Maximum volume limit of 2 liters
- Visual and status indicators for system state
- Connection monitoring with automatic reconnection

## üìñ Usage

1. Power on the system
2. Connect to the Blynk app
3. Select desired cup size or enable continuous pour mode
4. Monitor pour status through the app
5. System will automatically stop when target volume is reached

## üìä Status Indicators

- LED blinking patterns indicate different system states
- Blynk app provides real-time status updates
- Serial monitor shows detailed system statistics

## üì± Blynk Integration

### Widget Configuration

| Widget               | Type          | Range            | Description             |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Cup Size (V1)        | Value Display | 0-2000 ml        | Target pour volume      |
| Status (V2)          | Label         | Text             | System status display   |
| Calibration (V3)     | Value Display | 1.0-5.0 ml/pulse | Flow sensor calibration |
| Continuous Pour (V4) | Switch        | ON/OFF           | Manual control mode     |

### Setup Instructions

1. Create a new device in Blynk IoT
2. Add the widgets as specified in the table above
3. Configure each widget with the following settings:
   - Cup Size: Step size 50ml, Color #2196F3
   - Status: Large font, Color #4CAF50
   - Calibration: Step size 0.1, Color #FF9800
   - Continuous Pour: Color #E91E63

## üíª Code

The project consists of the following files:

- [`main.ino`](main.ino) - Main Arduino sketch containing the core functionality
  - Flow sensor integration
  - Blynk communication
  - Pour control logic
  - Safety features implementation

To get started with the code:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `main.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Install required libraries
4. Configure your credentials
5. Upload to ESP32

## üí≥ Payment Integration

The system integrates with blockchain payments through the [yodl-store-webhook](https://github.com/MihkelJ/yodl-store-webhook) service. This component:

- Processes blockchain transaction notifications
- Validates payment details
- Triggers the beer tap through Blynk integration
- Supports multiple beer taps with different configurations

### Setup Steps

1. Deploy the webhook service
2. Configure your beer tap in the webhook's environment variables:
   ```env
   BEER_TAPS='[
     {
       "transactionReceiverEns": "your.ens.name",
       "transactionMemo": "Beer",
       "transactionCurrency": "EUR",
       "transactionAmount": "4.2",
       "blynkDeviceToken": "YOUR_BLYNK_TOKEN",
       "blynkDevicePin": "V1",
       "blynkDevicePinValue": "500"
     }
   ]'
   ```
3. Set up the Blynk device token and pin mapping
